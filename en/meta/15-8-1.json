It is also illegal to grow foreign plant species in protected areas, in protected landscapes and everywhere above 400 meters above sea level.\n\nIceland is also a member of the [NOBANIS](https://nobanis.org/) project. The project is a cooperation between Northern European countries to reduce or prevent damage due to invasive species. The Icelandic Institute of Natural History participates in the NOBANIS project on behalf of Iceland. The main goal of NOBANIS is to act as a regional portal for sharing information on exotic and invasive species in North and Central Europe and to make this data available online. The resources accessible through the portal include information on the number of invasive or potentially invasive species in Iceland.\n","permalink":"/15-8-1/","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-08-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 456kB)","indicator":"15.8.1","indicator_sort_order":"15-08-01","layout":"indicator","published":true,"sdg_goal":"15","target":"By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species","target_id":"15.8","un_custodian_agency":"IUCN","un_designated_tier":"2","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Icelandic Institute of Natural History","source_periodicity_1":null,"source_earliest_available_1":null,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Iceland","source_url_1":"https://www.ni.is/","source_url_text_1":"Icelandic Institute of Natural History","source_statistical_classification_1":null,"source_contact_1":"ni@ni.is","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-24","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-24","target_number":"15.8","goal_number":"15"}
