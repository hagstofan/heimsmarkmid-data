Data from 1995 refer to all students, but the number of students outside of day courses is small. These new entrants are tracked for four years, six years and seven years. Those graduates are counted who have completed at least a two year programme at the upper secondary level according to the Statistics Iceland Register of Graduations. Some have completed both a general and a vocational programme and are counted both in the data on graduates in general and vocational education, but only once in the total.","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact.","comments_limitations":"According to [Law nr 91/2008 on primary education](https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008091.html) all children aged 6-16 years are required to attend primary education. Thus, completion rates from primary education are not measured but expected to be 100%. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Statistics Iceland","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Iceland","source_url_1":"https://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__skolamal__3_framhaldsskolastig__0_fsNemendur/SKO03123.px","source_url_text_1":"Completion rate and dropout from upper secondary education 1995-2018","source_release_date_1":null,"source_next_release_1":null,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistics","source_contact_1":"Upplysingar@hagstofa.is","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-24","national_data_updated_date":"2022-11-24","target_number":"4.1","goal_number":"4"}
