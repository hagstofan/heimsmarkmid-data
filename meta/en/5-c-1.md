As of 2021, Iceland fully meets the requirements for having in place systems to track, and make public, allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment. The country has in place gender responsive policies and corresponding resource allocations to support their implementation. There are government mechanisms to track allocations to gender equality and women’s empowerment through public financial management. Furthermore, there are government provisions to make information on allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment publicly available.
