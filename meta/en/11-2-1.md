  The 2020 data is Landsat data and is provided by the UNEP. Landsat imagery is
  used to identify and     classify the built-up pixels into 3 types depending
  on the share of built-up density (urban-ness) in   a 1-km2 circle of a given
  building (walking distance radius of about 564 meters around a given        
  building), see more -
  https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-11-07-01.pdf. The 2019
  data   is based on Travel together â€“ a policy on public transportation between
  municipalities,       prepared by the Ministry of Infrastructure. Data on
  population is obtained from Statistics Iceland,     and data on access to
  public transportation is obtained from the Icelandic Road and
  Coastal             Administration (IRCA).
