national_indicator_description: >-
  Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate. A value of 1
  indicates that land consumption rate is equal to the population growth rate (a
  sustainable ratio). A value below 1 means that land consumption rate is lower
  than the population growth rate, which is also considered a sustainable ratio.
  A value that exceeds 1 means that land consumption rate is greater than the
  population growth rate, which can be interpreted as an undesirable and
  unsustainable development.

  The indicator is a comparison between 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 data on land
  consumption. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

  Land cover classifications are available for Iceland from the CORINE
  (Coordination of Information on the Environment) inventory produced by the
  Copernicus programme. The classifications are updated every 6 years and
  contain information on a wide variety of land cover classes, including built
  areas and areas under construction.
