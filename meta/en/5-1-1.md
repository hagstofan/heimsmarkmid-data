[The Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights Irrespective of Gender, No. 150/2020,](https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2020150.html) aims to prevent gender-based discrimination and fight for equality between genders and equal opportunities, in all spheres of society. The Prime Minister’s Office is the competent body for the enforcement of the Act, while the Directorate of Equality is responsible for supervising its implementation and for providing advice, information and public education regarding gender equality. In addition, since 2020 all legislation is required to be gender neutral.
